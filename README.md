# Overview
This Python package introduces an option pricing and analysis module encapsulated within the OptionCalculator class. It serves as a comprehensive toolkit for financial analysts, investors, and decision-makers seeking detailed insights and accurate analysis from extensive financial datasets. The package provides a range of functions utilizing various financial models and numerical methods to compute option-related parameters and prices.

# Package Contents
### Introduction
The OptionCalculator class is the core of this package, aimed at providing a comprehensive set of functions for option pricing and analysis. It leverages several fundamental libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Math, SciPy, and yfinance to handle mathematical computations, data manipulation, visualization, and fetching financial data from Yahoo Finance.
### Functionality
The package covers a wide range of functionalities, including:

*Black-Scholes Model Calculations*: Computes option prices using the Black-Scholes model, determines implied volatility, and applies put-call parity.

*Arbitrage Detection*: Identifies potential arbitrage opportunities in the options market based on put-call parity violations.

*Option Strategies*: Implements strategies like long straddle, short straddle, synthetic long, and synthetic short positions.

*Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) Binomial Tree Model*: Calculates European call and put option prices using a binomial tree approach.

*Convergence Visualization*: Illustrates convergence of binomial tree prices with Black-Scholes prices.

*Monte-Carlo Simulation Price Function*: Computes option prices through Monte-Carlo simulations.

*Sensitivity Analysis Function*: Conducts sensitivity analysis based on various volatility levels.
### Error Handling
The package incorporates robust error handling mechanisms, encompassing type errors, value errors for out-of-range parameters, function input validation, boundary condition handling, mathematical errors, and informative error messaging for user guidance.
### Dataset Implementation
A real dataset from Yahoo Finance, containing AAPL options data, was utilized to perform option pricing calculations, implied volatility computations, and the analysis of potential arbitrage opportunities.

# Usage and Instructions
The package offers a wide range of functions that can be utilized for various financial analyses. Users can initialize the option_calculator class with specific parameters (stock price, strike price, risk-free rate, and time to maturity) and leverage functions individually or collectively for:

1. Calculating option prices using different models (Black-Scholes, binomial tree, Monte-Carlo simulations).
2. Assessing implied volatilities and identifying arbitrage opportunities.
3. Implementing diverse option strategies and conducting sensitivity analysis based on volatility levels.
Please refer to the detailed function descriptions within the README for specific instructions on using each function and handling potential errors.

# Conclusion
This OptionCalculator package is designed to offer a comprehensive suite of tools for option pricing, analysis, and strategic decision-making within the financial domain. With its array of functionalities and robust error handling mechanisms, it provides a reliable framework for users to explore, compute, and analyze option-related parameters and prices effectively.
